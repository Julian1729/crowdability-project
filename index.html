            <p>Dear Reader,</p>
            <p>Hi, Matt Milner, Founder and CEO of Crowdability here...</p>
            <p>As you know, I’m about to reveal the details behind a groundbreaking device...</p>
            <p>
               Something we’ve been calling, <strong>“The COVID-Killer.”</strong></p>
            <p>And as you’ll learn during this presentation, the groundbreaking technology behind this device was originally developed for the U.S. Military... In fact, it was originally designed to help combat bio-terrorism and chemical attacks... But after the coronavirus appeared earlier this year...</p>
            <p>The inventor of this technology decided to start a company to fight this pandemic… And that’s when he secured the exclusive patents to this device. </p>
            <p>Meaning, this is the only company in the world that has the ability to commercialize and sell this technology.</p>
            <p>And as you’ll discover, not only could this technology help protect people across the globe... and get them back to work...</p>
            <p>But it could potentially hand investors like you massive profits…</p>

               Basically, they discovered a <em>classified military-research project...</em></p>
            <p>And the goal of this military project was clear:</p>
            <p>To develop a technology to kill bacteria — in mid-air, instantaneously.</p>
            <p>Now, initially, this project was designed to fight off bio-terrorist attacks...</p>
            <p>But as a number of tests and studies eventually proved, this technology has the potential not just to kill bacteria, but to kill various pathogens, too...</p>
            <p>Pathogens like the coronavirus.</p>
            <p>Which is why, after the coronavirus pandemic swept the world earlier this year, the inventor of this technology made a decision...</p>
            <p>He decided to leverage the technology he’d developed for the military...</p>

            <h2>How BIG This Business Could Become!</h2>
            <p>Unlike many complicated Silicon Valley startups that give everything away for free and hope to make money down the road...</p>
            <p>This company’s business model is very simple and straightforward…</p>
            <p>Basically, it’s going to sell its products to consumers like us, and to businesses, too.</p>
            <p>And its devices will cost about $1,000.</p>
            <p>Now, at first blush, that number might sound high...</p>
            <p>But that price-point is comparable to the high-end HEPA filters you can buy currently...</p><a class="bigbusiness__amazon lightbox" data-featherlight="/assets/images/image4.png" href="#"><img src="/assets/images/image4.png" alt="HEPA filters priced just under and over $1000" title="HEPA filters around $1000"></a>
            <p>And keep in mind, this new device is infinitely more powerful and effective than standard HEPA filters.</p>
            <p>So now let’s talk about how big this business could potentially get...</p>
            <p>
               There are roughly <strong>128 million households </strong>in the United States...</p>
            <p>And another <strong>32 million businesses.</strong></p>
            <p>So the potential market in the U.S. alone is very, very large.</p>
            <p>In fact, according to Grand View Research, in 2019 — that’s before the pandemic — the global air purifier market was valued at $8 billion.  </p>
            <p>An $8 billion market.  That was huge already. </p>
            <p>But because of the pandemic, a research company called Arizton is forecasting the market will soon reach $90 billion.</p>
            <p>So let’s say this startup we’ve been telling you about is able to capture even just a tiny fraction of this market...</p>

            <h2>How much could early investors like you make in profits?</h2>
            <h3>(HINT: It could be as much as $1.2 million!)</h3>

            <p>Well, today, you have the chance to invest in this company at a market value of just $5 million...</p>
            <p>So, even at the LOWEST end of our forecasts, you’d be selling your stake at a market value of $150 million. </p>
            <p> <strong>That’s a 2,900% profit. </strong></p><a class="lightbox profits__chart" data-featherlight="assets/images/image3.png" href="#"><img src="assets/images/image3.png"></a>
            <p>Again, that’s like turning every $1,000 you invest into $30,000... </p>
            <p>And every $10,000 you invest into $300,000!</p>
            <p>And if this company ends up hitting the top end of your sales projections...</p>
            <p>Well, then you’re talking about potential profits of <strong>11,900%!</strong></p><a class="lightbox profits__chart" data-featherlight="assets/images/image2.png" href="#"><img src="assets/images/image2.png"></a>
            <p>That’s like turning a $1,000 investment into $120,000...</p>
            <p>And $10,000 into $1.2 million!</p>
            <p>And keep in mind, this is all based on the company capturing far less than 1% of the overall market...</p>
            <p>And furthermore, it doesn’t take into account how vastly superior this company’s technology is compared to its competitors. </p>
            <p>That’s why we told you earlier that our 2,900% profit forecast might turn out to be conservative.</p>
            <p>And it helps explain why we’ve been so excited to share this opportunity with you. </p>
            <p>Frankly, this could become one of the most profitable investments that we’ve ever identified.</p>
