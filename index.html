            <p>Dear Reader,</p>
            <p>Hi, Matt Milner, Founder and CEO of Crowdability here...</p>
            <p>As you know, I’m about to reveal the details behind a groundbreaking device...</p>
            <p>
               Something we’ve been calling, <strong>“The COVID-Killer.”</strong></p>
            <p>And as you’ll learn during this presentation, the groundbreaking technology behind this device was originally developed for the U.S. Military... In fact, it was originally designed to help combat bio-terrorism and chemical attacks... But after the coronavirus appeared earlier this year...</p>
            <p>The inventor of this technology decided to start a company to fight this pandemic… And that’s when he secured the exclusive patents to this device. </p>
            <p>Meaning, this is the only company in the world that has the ability to commercialize and sell this technology.</p>
            <p>And as you’ll discover, not only could this technology help protect people across the globe... and get them back to work...</p>
            <p>But it could potentially hand investors like you massive profits…</p>

               Basically, they discovered a <em>classified military-research project...</em></p>
            <p>And the goal of this military project was clear:</p>
            <p>To develop a technology to kill bacteria — in mid-air, instantaneously.</p>
            <p>Now, initially, this project was designed to fight off bio-terrorist attacks...</p>
            <p>But as a number of tests and studies eventually proved, this technology has the potential not just to kill bacteria, but to kill various pathogens, too...</p>
            <p>Pathogens like the coronavirus.</p>
            <p>Which is why, after the coronavirus pandemic swept the world earlier this year, the inventor of this technology made a decision...</p>
            <p>He decided to leverage the technology he’d developed for the military...</p>
            <p>And use it to create a device to protect ordinary citizens like you...</p>
            <p>And now he’s started a groundbreaking company — a private startup company — that’s about to release this device commercially...</p>
            <p>So consumers like you — and like all of us — can be protected from the coronavirus… whether we’re in our home, our office, or even a restaurant or a store. </p>
